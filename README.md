# How to progress after Le Wagon

Hi there!

You've just finished some of the most intensive and hardest weeks of your life.
But you've made it! Congratulations, you are now full-stack developers able to
build great web projects from scratch.

But Le Wagon is just the beginning of a long journey. Being a developer is an
incredibly rewarding position because you get to learn new things every day. But
it is also a challenging role. With this repository, I want to share with you
some tips and resources to keep on improving your skills as efficiently as
possible.

## Solve your problems alone

One of the most difficult things after Le Wagon is that you won't have teachers
and TA anymore to help you every day. Of course, you have Le Wagon community on
Slack but it is not as instantaneous as a ticket. After Le Wagon, you should aim
at being really autonomous to solve your code problems as fast as possible. To
do this, you need 3 skills:

### Learn to read your error messages

During the bootcamp, you may have seen teachers solving problems you had been
struggling on for dozens of minutes just by reading your error message. It takes
some practice but learning how to find your error messages and how to read them
will solve 90% of your problems. Sometimes it will give you directly an answer,
most of the time it will narrow the scope of the problem. Good developers are
(almost) always happy when they see an error message because they know it will
help them solve their bug.

### Become a binding.pry god

When the error message does not directly give you an answer, learn how to debug
with `binding.pry` (or `debugger` for Javascript). Every time I see a bug I
don't quite understand, the first thing I do is put a `binding.pry` in my code
to see what is going on and how do my variables look like at this specific
moment. With good `binding.pry` skills, you will rock in the developer world.

P.S: Aaron Patterson, one of the most famous Ruby developer, is a "puts
debugger". It is another way to deal with errors. Enjoy
[this article] to learn more.

### Learn to Google a problem

When you are facing a problem you really don't know, get used to Google it.
99.9% of the times, you will find somebody who had a pretty similar problem on
StackOverflow. Google skills are the most important ones for a developer.

Other places you can find some help are: [Reddit]
and also directly on Github, in the [issues] section. There, you can ask your
question to people working with the same tool as you. Sometimes you also get a
reply directly from the creator of the project.

I'm talking about these two because they are not as much referenced as
StackOverflow but are sometimes more qualitative/recent !

## How to progress after Le Wagon

Here are my personal advice on how to progress after Le Wagon. I myself did/read
half of the resources and heard really good reviews from Le Wagon alumnis about
the other ones. You can find free PDF of most of the following books on the web
but, if you can, please support the authors. ;)

### Get your basics right

After Le Wagon, a lot of things look like magic because you don't have time to
learn the core concepts. I found it super valuable to get back to the roots and
learn more about topics not directly related to a language to get this right! If
I was doing Le Wagon today, I would read the resources below directly after it.

1. Learn the most valuable Computer Science concepts in 1 afternoon with
   [Computer Science Distilled]. Best book ever!
1. Improve your Git level by reading
   [Ry's Git Tutorial], it is free and amazing!
1. Enjoy a funny dive into DevOps with [The Phoenix Project].

### Improve your Ruby skills

If you know Ruby well, Rails will be so much easier!

1. Read [Eloquent Ruby]
1. Read [99 bottles of OOP]

#### To go further

1. Subscribe to [Ruby Tapas]

### Master Rails

Because of course!

1. Read the [Rails guides]
1. Read [The Rails 5 Way]

#### To go further

1. Read [Rails Anti-Patterns]
1. Subscribe to [Go Rails]

### Get fluent in Javascript

Javascript is primordial but you don't know it well after Le Wagon. Take some
   time to improve your skills. [Wes Bos] is one of the best teacher to start
   learning JavaScript. He have a good amount of free stuff. And some other paid
   ones.

1. You fall asleep during LeWagon's morning classes ? Want to know the crazy new
   hot stuff like ES6, ES7 and ESNext ? [ES6 for everyone] (paid)
1. Want to make 1 awesome challenge per day ? Feel the need to practice ?
   Say hello to [JavasScript30].

#### To go further

1. Read the [You don't know JS] books (available for free on Github).
1. [JavaScript: The Good Parts], a must read.

## After all of this is done

Web development is full of hype. However, I would not recommend you to learn the
last Javascript library (I know you want to ;) ) just after Le Wagon. Take the
time to master your existing skills before diving into something more advanced
alone. Below are some options for when you feel comfortable (no real reading
list, I am an expert in none of these technologies).

### Go back to the roots to became a real software engineer

1. It is not too late to learn Computer Science. Here is
   [a program I plan to do one day].

### Try something different in back-end

1. Learn a functional language. [Elixir] and [Phoenix] (the most popular
   framework for Elixir) are great choices for Rubyist as Elixir was written by
   a former Rails core contributor.

### Introduce yourself to data-science

1. I am currently following the [Data Analyst Nanodegree on Udacity]. It have
   been great so far!

### Focus on front-end

1. Learn how to structure properly your vanilla CSS with [BEM]: for reusable
   components & a real naming convention for your next big projects.
1. Then, show your skills to the entire world on [Codepen] by sharing some
   [next level Japanese Sushi Toggle Button] ! :yum:
1. Ofc, your Codepen profile can be written in something a bit more advanced if
    you wish. Why not [Stylus] (some cool features and ponctuation free) and
    [Haml] (_a bit_ more readable HTML) ?
1. Want to know what Bootstrap does behind the scenes in it's 4th version ? Wes
   has a free [Flexbox] lesson just for you ! You'll see that it's helps a lot
   for some homemade responsive Webdesign.
1. CSS Grid is another cool feature released not so long ago. We don't have any
   goods links here but feel free to pull request one ! :smirk:

### Become a mobile developer

1. Learn a trendy JS library (ReactJS or Vue.js for example). One of the best
   website for updated lessons is [egghead]. I do personnaly have a subscription
   as it allows to quickly get introduced to new topics before going deeper by
   yourself if it catches your interest (it is sometimes written directly by
   the founders too) !
1. Get hyped of the possibilites of React Native by this [presentation] of
    SÃ©bastien Saunier.
1. Learn a bit more of how to link React to your Rails app with these pair of
   [slides].
1. Then, if you're conviced and want to create native mobile apps for Android &
   iPhone, feel free to buy some [Full Stack courses] from Stephen Grider !
   :tada: They aren't very expensive, 10$ each.
1. If you're not really into JavaScript, you can try some new things like
   [Jekyll], [Middleman] or [Hanami] (similar to Rails).

### Tasty treats for Web developers

I personally enjoy podcasts a lot. You can listen to them anywhere (bus, car
etc...), there a plenty of them and it's a great way to be aware of the trends
while being busy doing something else.

1. One of them is [Syntax], by Wes Bos & Scott Tolinski, creator of
   [LevelUpTuts], a cool dude too. Their show is so funny and you learn a lot of
   things about pretty much all.
1. [Le Ruby Nouveau] is a more classic one but it's nice too. Oh and they have a
   [Slack] too, join it. As my Grand Ma always says: the more Ruby Devs,
   the better ! :muscle:
1. [The Web Ahead], didn't listened to it yet but some people recommended it to
   me, so it's probably nice.

## Other important resources

You should know about some resources. They will help you a ton in your code
every day. Here is a list of the main ones I can think of.

* [CSS] and [HTML] references
* [Awesome Ruby]
* [Ruby] and [Rails] style guides
* [Ruby Weekly] newsletter
* [Exercism] to test your skills with great coding challenges
